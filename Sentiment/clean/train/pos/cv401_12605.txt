last

rather
excessive
havent
mentioned
script
plotwise
ok
though
jackrose

beautifully
developed
ive
feeling
thats
actors
credit
anything
dialogue
well
titanic
set
period
drama
saw
little
indication
period
far
dialogue
concerned
really
use
phrases
like
goddamn
back
turn
century

would
someone
talk

bit

bit
excessive
least

havent
even
mentioned
james

utterly
heavenly
though
dad

lot
start
get
bit
bored
ive

longer
thought
would
leaves
couple
questions
worth
oscars
hell
dont
talk
oscars
bloomin
farce
deserving
number
departments
though
last
question
suggest
one
best
films
alltime
nope
dont
think
certainly
one
powerful
memorable
films
ive
ever
seen
dont
think
quite
ranks
one
alltime
favourites
fact
theyre
reportedly
making
titanic
well
guess
thats
typical
hollywood
