ill
bet
shes
one
best

thats
shame
brings
much

sympathetic
im
dying
see
win
least
oscar

doesnt
show
happened
children
till
halfway

prevents
us
really
making

move
though
theyre
memories
one
particular
character
end
lost
control
sethe
takes
bed
unable
truly
identify
anymore
despite
tediousness
perhaps
thats
point
distancing
end
film
may
part
way

like
would
real

laced
touch
optimism
acting
winfrey
amazing
anticipate
get
oscar
nomination
everyone
raving
thandie
newtons
performance
rewarded
however
must
noted
everyone
easiest
part
act
like

mouth
open
think
theres
another
performance
worthy
oscar
conisderation
kimberly
elise
daugher
stay
sensible
sane
carry
burden
mothers
loss
reality
towards
end
newton
isnt

pulls
even
better
despite
