bad
guys
symbolic
nazis
instead
using
old
propaganda
seriously
disjointed
attempt
show
us
something
already
know
wizards
gives
us
lot
footage
nazi
tanks
airplanes
hitler
giving
speeches
however
dont
see
reason
considered
bad
see
atrocities
committed
even
real
battle
footage
absolutely
connection
made
armies
evil
third
reich
even
given
cursory
explanation
stuff
inspiring
first
place
needed
thought
much
thoroughly
point
made
since
subject
matter
deserves
better
treatment
id
like
assume
bakshi
trying
say
nationalist
movement
drove
nazis
could
happen
anywhere
time
must
therefore
vigilant
however
im
sure
want
give
much
credit
