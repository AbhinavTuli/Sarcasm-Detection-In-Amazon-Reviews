moronic

obscurities
generally
though
elfont
kaplan
graceful

movement
even
manage
capture
altmanesque
feel
film
time
time
thing
note
though
hokey
really
admirable
actually
like

wigger
character
almost
believable
almost
course
lauren
ambrose
wonderful
denise
one
character
could
used
even
though
would
changed
entirety
film
however
character
denise
really
doesnt
work
film
really
thought
shes
far
witty
realized
least
first
half
belong
film
whenever
appears
automatically
gives
everything
delightfully
satirical
tone
shes
cynic
intellectual
shes
interesting
character
provides
entertainment
even
damages
already
damaged
characters
may
ruin
film

shes
screen
sit
think
well
least
well
entertained
couple
things
dont
work
mikes

everything
much
sacrificial
lamb

general
aimless
bitchy

perhaps
one
thing
doesnt

jenna
eflmans

basically
worst
thing
film
real
reason
im
giving
low
rating
refuses
give
us
fully
realized
characters
insists
follow
around
complete
stereotypes
movies
things
inane
unlike
anything
wed
dont
