intention
reviewing

fluffy
inconsequential
plotline
downside
film
actually
starts
pretty
slowly
first
hour
tossing
guffaws
never
really
generating
kind
steady
flow
energy
sets
hand
amazing
production
design
costumes
perfect
casting
ideal
kept
hoping
film
would
pick
turn
yet
another
mediocre
outing
man
wasnt
long
fully
engaged
characters
entertained
many
zingers
delivered
backandforth
allen
hunt
actually
interested
resolution
flick
also
appreciated
allen
played
fine
line
homage
films
old
parody
actual
reinvention
note
therons
entire
female
persona
drenched
film
noir
cool
course
films
like
little
real
tension
plot
need
solid
actors
keep
interested
quickfire
dialogue
allen
great
job
playing
character
isnt
typical
new
york
jewish
neurotic
cheating
insecure
husband
dude

pretty
well
especially

new
era
equality
amongst
men
doesnt
miss
beat
allens
fastpaced
dialogue
didnt
care
much
running
joke
dying
whenever
left
room
overall
really
good
especially

lets
recap
great
looking
picture
nice
jazzy
score
funny
oneliners
especially
second
half
decent
plotline
although
shouldnt
expect
real
mystery
anything
solid
acting
around
cant
say
even
remotely
close
allens
best
work
certainly
believe
step
right
direction
especially
dinky
decade
films
went
probably
better
geared
towards
allen
fans
anyone
else
would
still
recommend
film
anyone
looking
cute
oldschool
kind
vibe
chemistry
leads
zippy
dialogue
satisfying
